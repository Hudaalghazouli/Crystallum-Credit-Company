## Project Summary:
We are a credit card company named Crystallum
Using credit card holder information to teach via supervised machine learning how much credit an applicant receives (credit limit)
Linear Regression tries to guess if we enter tick marks like income and education, etc what our model will predict the credit limit should be. With our sample of use cases, we are wanting to add value to the model.

## Project Outline:
1.	Pick technology pieces to support the project. (3 or more) 
2.	Present how we trained a then used machine learning in this real-world scenario that can lead to a Tableau. 
3.	In Tableau further exampling the use of machine learning by showcasing a few individuals and how that data can be analyzed and relied on for making business decisions for Crystallum
